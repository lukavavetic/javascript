OOP IN JS: PROTOTYPES
- prototype contains all methods
- object can access those methods
- objects are linked to a prototype object
- PROTOTYPAL INHERITANCE: the prototype contains methods that are accessible to all objects to that prototype
- behavior is delegated to the linked prototype object

3 WAYS OF IMPLEMENTING PROTOTYPAL INHERITANCE IN JS
1. CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTIONS
- technique to create objects from a function;
- this is how built-in objects like Arrays, Maps or Sets are actually implemented

2. ES6 Classes
- modern alternative to constructor function syntax;
- "Syntatic sugar": behind the scenes, ES6 classes work exactly like constructor functions;
- ES6 classes do not behave like classes in "classical OOP";

3. Object.create()
- 

- arrow function cannot work as constructor because they don't have a this keyword
