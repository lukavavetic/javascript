// first-class functions
// Javascript treats functions as first-class citizen
// this means that functions are simply values
// functions are just another "type" of objects
// it can be stored in variables and properties
// it can be passed as argument to other functions
// it can be returned from functions 

// higher-order functions
// a function that receives another function as an argument, that returns a new function or both
// this is only possible because of first-class functions
// example of higher-order function = addEventListener func
