HOISTING
- makes some types of variables accessible/usable in the code before they are actually declared. "Variables lifted to the top of their scope."
- before execution, code is scanned for variable declarations and for each variable a new property is created in the VARIABLE ENVIRONMENT OBJECT

                          hoisted?   initial value?         scope?
function declarations -   yes        actual function        block  - only in stric mode, otherwise: function
var variables -           yes        undefined              function
let and cost              no         <uninitialized>, TDZ   block
function expressions             depeneds weather they are created using var or let/const
and arrows 

TEMPORAL DEAD ZONE, LET AND cost
- referenceError: cannot access 'job' before initialization
- referenceError: x is not defined
- make const variables actually work

WHY HOISTING?
- using function before actual declaration
