Javascript engine
- program that executes javascript code
- chrome engine is V8 engine, other browser has their own engine
- every JS engine contains CALL STACK and HEAP
- CALL STACK is where our code is executed - execution context
- HEAP - where objects are stored in memory

COMPILATION
- entire code is converted into machine code at once, and written to a binary file that can be executed by a computer

INTEPRETATION
- interpreter runs through the source code and executes it line by line
- interpreted languages are much slower than compiled

JUST-IN-TIME (JIT)
- modern JS uses JIT
- entire code is converted into machine code at once then executed immediately

STEPS:
1. parsing the code into the data structure called AST
2. compilation - generate machine code from AST
3. execution
4. during the execution code goes through optimization process

WEB APIs such as DOM, Timers, Fetch API and so on are accessible through window object
JS also contains callback queue - click, timer, data..
