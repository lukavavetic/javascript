- JS is a high-level object oriented, multi-paradigm programming language
- prototype-based object oriented, multi-paradigm, interpreted or just-in-time compiled, dynamic, single threaded, garabage-collected programming language
with first-class functions and non-blocking event loop concurrency model

PARADIGM
- paradigm: an approach and mindset of structuring code which will direct your coding style and technique
- paradigms: 1) procedural 2) OOP 3) functional programming (FP)

HIGH-LEVEL 
- it manages memory for us

PROTOTYPE-BASED
- everything is object in JS except integer and so on. 
- for example, we can use push method on array because array is created from protoype (blueprint array) which contains few methods and when
array is created, it inherits all those methods from the blueprint

FIRST CLASS FUNCTIONS
- in a language with first-class functions, functios are simply treated as variables. we can pass them into other functions and return them from functions

DYNAMIC
- dynamically typed language. no data type definitions. type becomes known at runtime. data type of variable is automatically changed

CONCURRENCY MODEL
- how the JS engine handles multiple tasks happening at the same time
- JS runs in one single thread, so it can only do one thing at a time
- What about long-running task? JS uses even loop: takes long running tasks, executes them in the background and puts them back in the main thread once they are finished
